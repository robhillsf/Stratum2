Key Decision,Establish the tonal center and gravitational field,Determines tendency tone behavior and interval relationships throughout,"key_signatures, scales, tones, tone_relationships","Major keys, minor keys, modal centers, atonal approaches",All subsequent decisions depend on tonal/modal context,"C major for bright character, A minor for melancholic, D Dorian for Celtic","Choosing key without considering voice ranges, ignoring modal implications",Key choice affects all voice-leading behavior and harmonic possibilities
Harmonic System Selection,Choose between functional hierarchy vs 20th-century techniques,"Determines voice-leading rules, resolution patterns, harmonic logic","harmonic_strategies, modal_harmony_properties, functional_harmony_analysis, extended_harmony_techniques","Modal harmony, functional harmony, extended/post-functional harmony",Choice determines available techniques in subsequent steps,"Modal for film scoring, functional for jazz standards, extended for contemporary classical","Mixing systems inconsistently, not following through with chosen approach",Each system has different voice-leading rules and aesthetic goals
Replacement Techniques ,Apply substitutions and reharmonization to basic progressions,"Chromatic voice-leading, smooth bass motion, harmonic sophistication","relative_substitutions, modulation_techniques, functional_harmony_analysis","Modal interchange, borrowed chords, tritone substitution, secondary dominants",Only applies if functional harmony chosen in step 2,"vi for I (deceptive resolution), tritone substitution in jazz, modal interchange","Over-substituting, losing harmonic clarity, poor voice-leading in substitutions","Substitutions should enhance, not obscure, the underlying harmonic logic"
Core Harmonic Identity,Define the chord's structural DNA: Root-Quality-Bass-Mode,Unified structure determining all voice-leading implications,"chord_identity_structure, tones, chords, scales","Root note, chord quality, bass note/inversion, modal context",Identity determines color and voicing options in next steps,"C major/C/Ionian vs C major/E/Dorian - same notes, different implications","Ignoring bass note implications, modal context confusion",The four DNA elements work together to determine harmonic behavior
Color ,"Add emotional shading through extensions, alterations, modal signals","Non-chord tones, tension-resolution patterns, harmonic color","modal_color_tones, non_chord_tones, chords (extended), glossary","Extensions (7,9,11,13), alterations (b9,#9,#11,b13), modal signals",Color choices depend on harmonic identity from step 4,"Major 7th for classical, b7 for blues, #11 for Lydian modal signal","Adding color that contradicts modal context, over-extending simple contexts","Color should enhance, not contradict, the chosen harmonic system"
Voicing & Arrangement,Shape the chord physically and spatially in musical registers,"Voice distribution, spacing, doubling, registral balance","voicing_types, register_ranges, spacing_techniques, chord_voicing_analysis","Register distribution, drop voicings, clusters/quartal, voice leading",Final step translating harmonic decisions into actual notes,"Drop 2 for jazz guitar, close position for piano, wide spacing for orchestra","Ignoring instrumental ranges, poor voice leading between chords",Voicing makes harmonic decisions audible and playable
